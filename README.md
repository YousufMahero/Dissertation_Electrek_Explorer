# Data Analysis and Developing Tools to Enable High-Adventure, Low-impact EV-Tourism in Scotland 
  Growing concerns about climate change, as well as worries about people’s over-reliance on fossil fuels for transportation, have compelled governments and policymakers to encourage people to use alternative energy transportation. With renewable resources in electricity production, electric vehicle (EV) technology has become the most popular among these alternatives. As such, there are incredibly ambitious plans to electrify Scotland car transport by 2030. However, there are also numerous barriers to overcome in this respect. 
<br />
  Due to the drawbacks of EVs, such as limited range or long and uncertain charging time, people avoid using electric vehicles, especially when planning long trips. Considering the inadequacy of the charging infrastructure, they do not see EVs as an option in their countryside trips due to the range anxiety, a phenomenon that can be defined as the fear of running out of power before reaching a charging station (Gollapudi and Kollias, 2021). This fear is especially the case for models that are pure battery powered (BEVs). 
<br />
  Electrek Explorer, the sponsor company of this study, which focuses on the nature-based tourism field of electrification, is helping the transformation in driving tourism by pointing out these barriers and coming up with solutions to them. It promotes electric travel and eco-tourism through its web page and application, where all the information required for an e-travel is available for eco-conscious tourists. By working with the company, three tools were developed to help users plan their electric vehicle journeys with data obtained from entirely free and publicly available sources. All these data are stored in the database designed in this thesis.
<br />
  Firstly, with the help of the main maps created, charging stations and nature tourism areas are displayed together. Thank filtering feature, charging stations can be filtered according to the charging technologies, as well as filtering according to the place where they are installed. In addition to the location information of the station with pop-ups on the map, activities within a 1-km radius where the tourists can spend their time while their vehicle is charging are also listed. 
  With station density maps helping to identify the areas currently underserved by EV charging infrastructure, various statistics about available charging stations numbers in 32 unitary districts of Scotland are studied. 
<br />
  As the last feature, the EV routing algorithm is designed to give the quickest energy-efficient route with a charging strategy. With given information by the user about EV and itinerary, a route that answers questions such as where to charge and how much is created, and the determined charging stations are inserted to the route. In order to achieve meaningful outcomes in practice, realistic energy consumption and charging time functions that consider external factors such as temperature and road topology are designed. Also, partial charging schemes and non-linear charging functions under different charging strategies are allowed in the model. Although low estimation is made for energy consumption when comparing the model with applications with similar functions in the market, satisfactory results is achieved in the estimation of charging times. It was also aimed to increase motivation for EV use by adding carbon emissions to the output report, which is offered only in paid applications.
<br />
  In line with Electrek Explorer's objective, the extensive maps and EV planning function of this study provide eco-tourists with precise range and energy-efficient routes for a variety of vacation types and natural destinations, ensuring that they arrive at their destinations in comfort. As a consequence, it aims to eliminate the potential barriers to the widespread adaption of electric vehicles and encourage further EV use in the tourism industry.
